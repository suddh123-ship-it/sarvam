# 🚗 AutoCare Motors — Multilingual Voice Bot for Auto Dealership Service

> A real-time, Hindi/Hinglish **voice bot** that answers a dealership's service line,
> books service appointments, checks recalls, handles complaints, escalates angry
> customers to a human, and logs an **AI-generated summary of every call** to a live
> CRM dashboard.
>
> Built for the **Sarvam AI Pre-Sales Engineer** assignment — a real enterprise use
> case powered end-to-end by **Sarvam's STT + LLM + TTS** stack over live telephony.

## 🏢 The Enterprise Problem

Indian auto dealerships (Maruti, Tata, Mahindra, Hyundai…) run high-volume service
desks that are overwhelmed with repetitive inbound calls: *"book my car service",*
*"is there a recall on my model?",* *"reschedule my slot".* These calls are:

- **Repetitive & Tier-1** — 60–70% follow the same 3–4 intents.
- **Multilingual & code-mixed** — customers speak Hindi, English, and Hinglish
  interchangeably ("*morning slot chahiye, not evening*").
- **Costly** — human agents handle each call at high per-minute cost, with long
  hold times during peak hours.

A **voice bot that natively understands Indian languages and Hinglish** can absorb
the Tier-1 load, book appointments 24/7, and hand off only the complex/angry cases
to humans — while giving managers a **searchable log of every conversation**.

### Call flow (per turn)

1. Customer calls the Twilio number → Twilio POSTs to **`/voice/inbound`**.
2. Bot greets in Hindi and gathers speech; each turn POSTs to **`/voice/gather`**.
3. Speech → **Sarvam STT (Saaras v3)** → text.
4. Text + conversation history → **Sarvam LLM (sarvam-105b)** → context-aware reply
   (with intent detection, entity extraction, and escalation logic layered on top).
5. Reply → **Sarvam TTS (Bulbul v2)** → natural Hindi audio, played back to caller.
6. On hang-up/escalation → LLM writes a **call summary**; the caller is matched to a
   CRM record by phone number and their **status is updated** (`call_completed` /
   `escalated`). Everything appears live on the **dashboard**.

## 🔊 Which Sarvam APIs Are Used — and Why

Sarvam is the **core intelligence** of this bot, not an afterthought. Three Sarvam
APIs are used on **every call**:

| Sarvam API | Model | Where | Why it's used |
|------------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Speech-to-Text** | **Saaras v3** (`saaras:v3`) | [`sarvam.py › speech_to_text()`](app/services/sarvam.py) | Transcribes the caller's Hindi/Hinglish speech. Saaras is built for Indian languages + code-mixing, which generic STT handles poorly. Runs in `unknown`-language mode so it auto-detects. |
| **LLM / Chat** | **sarvam-105b** | [`sarvam.py › chat_completion()`](app/services/sarvam.py) | Generates the dealership agent's replies **and** the post-call summaries. An India-tuned LLM produces natural Hinglish responses with the right cultural tone ("ji", "aap"). |
| **Text-to-Speech** | **Bulbul v2** (`bulbul:v2`, voice `anushka`) | [`sarvam.py › text_to_speech()`](app/services/sarvam.py) | Speaks the reply back in a natural Indian voice. Bulbul's Indian-language prosody sounds far more native than generic TTS reading Hindi. |

**Multilingual / code-mixing:** the bot handles **Hindi and English, mixed freely
(Hinglish)** — e.g. *"Kal 11 baje ka time fix karo, I have a meeting at 2."* This is
exactly the India-specific capability the assignment calls for, and it's driven by
Sarvam's models end-to-end.

> **Note on telephony STT:** Twilio's built-in speech recognition is used as a fast
> first pass inside the gather webhook; when a recording is available, **Sarvam
> Saaras v3** transcribes it for higher-accuracy Indian-language STT. TTS and the LLM
> are 100% Sarvam.

## 🛠️ Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.11** (see [`.python-version`](.python-version))
- A [Sarvam AI](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/) API key
- A [Twilio](https://console.twilio.com) account + a voice-capable phone number
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) (or any tunnel) to expose localhost to Twilio — **only
  for local telephony**; the hosted Render URL needs no tunnel.

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/suddh123-ship-it/sarvam.git
cd sarvam

# 2. Create a virtualenv and install deps
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure secrets
cp .env.example .env           # then edit .env with your real keys

# 4. Run
python run.py
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8000`. Open
**http://localhost:8000/dashboard**.

### `.env` variables

See [`.env.example`](.env.example). Required:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SARVAM_API_KEY` | Sarvam STT/TTS/LLM auth (`sk_...`) |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio account SID (`AC...`) |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Twilio auth token |
| `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` | Your Twilio number in E.164 (e.g. `+12408720864`) |
| `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` | Default TTS/STT language (default `hi-IN`) |
| `DEBUG` | `true` locally (hot reload), `false` in production |

> 🔒 `.env` is **git-ignored** — secrets are never committed. In production they're
> set as environment variables in the Render dashboard.

### Connect Twilio (local)
1. Start a tunnel: `ngrok http 8000` → copy the `https://…ngrok…` URL.
2. Twilio Console → your number → **Voice Configuration**:
   - *A call comes in* → Webhook → `https://<ngrok>/voice/inbound` (HTTP POST)
   - *Call status changes* → `https://<ngrok>/voice/status` (HTTP POST)

---

## ☁️ Deployment (Render)

This project is deployed on Render — **no ngrok needed**, Twilio points straight at
the public Render URL. Full steps in **[DEPLOY_RENDER.md](DEPLOY_RENDER.md)**.

- Blueprint: [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) (secrets injected via the dashboard, never
  committed).
- Start command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- Twilio voice webhook → `https://<your-app>.onrender.com/voice/inbound`

## 📖 Demo Runbook

### Option A — Call the live bot (full experience)

1. **Open the dashboard** first so you can watch it update live:
   👉 **https://sarvam-9mo2.onrender.com/dashboard**
   You'll see 3 seeded customers (Rajesh Kumar, Priya Sharma, Amit Patel), all
   `ACTIVE`.
2. **Call the bot:** 📞 **+1 240 872 0864**
   *(Calling from **+91 95153 50276** matches you to customer "Rajesh Kumar", whose
   status will update after the call.)*
3. **Have a conversation in Hindi/Hinglish**, for example:
   - *"Namaste, meri car ki service karwani hai."*
   - *"Swift hai meri, 2022 model."*
   - *"Kal subah 10 baje ka slot chahiye, regular service aur oil change."*
   - *"Theek hai, kal 10 baje aaunga. Dhanyawad!"*
4. **Hang up.** Within a few seconds the dashboard shows:
   - The matched customer flips to **`CALL COMPLETED`** (or **`ESCALATED`** if you
     were angry / asked for a manager).
   - A new entry in **Recent Calls** with an **AI-generated summary** and extracted
     chips (vehicle, service, date, intent).

**Try the escalation path:** be irate — *"Ye teesri baar same problem aa rahi hai,
mujhe abhi manager se baat karni hai!"* — and watch the call end as `ESCALATED`.

> **Trial-account note:** if the Twilio account is on trial, you can only call
> from/to **verified numbers**, and Twilio plays a short trial message before the bot
> answers. Verify your number under Twilio Console → *Verified Caller IDs*.

### Option B — Explore without calling
- Browse the dashboard and API directly:
  - Dashboard UI: `/dashboard`
  - Raw JSON feed: [`/api/dashboard`](https://sarvam-9mo2.onrender.com/api/dashboard)

## 🧪 Testing Locally (no phone required)

Simulate a full Hindi/Hinglish conversation, code-mixing, and the escalation flow
against the real Sarvam APIs:

```bash
python tests/test_conversation.py
```

This prints a multi-turn booking conversation, a Hinglish code-mixing test, and an
angry-customer escalation test — a fast way to verify your `SARVAM_API_KEY` works.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Next Steps

**Current PoC scope**
- CRM and call records are **in-memory** (reset on restart) — a production build
  would use Postgres/CRM integration (Salesforce, Zoho, Leadsquared).
- STT uses a Twilio-first / Sarvam-recording hybrid; a production build would use
  **real-time streaming STT** (Sarvam via LiveKit/Pipecat) for lower latency.
- Appointment "booking" is conversational only — production would write to the
  dealership DMS and send a WhatsApp/SMS confirmation.

**Toward a 90-day enterprise rollout**
1. Real-time streaming STT/TTS (LiveKit + Sarvam) for sub-second latency.
2. Persistent datastore + DMS/CRM integration and calendar-based slot availability.
3. Post-call analytics pipeline (batch STT + diarization + LLM QA) using Sarvam's
   Call Analytics cookbook.
4. Human-in-the-loop warm transfer for escalations.
5. Observability, PII handling, and data-sovereignty controls (Sarvam's
   on-prem/India-hosted options are a key enterprise advantage).
